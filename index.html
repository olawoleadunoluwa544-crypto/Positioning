            <h1>Hair</h1>
            Hair types are generally classified into four categories based on texture and curl pattern: Type 1 is straight hair, ranging from fine and flat (1A) to coarse with slight bends (1C); Type 2 is wavy hair, with loose waves (2A), more defined S-shaped waves (2B), and thick, frizzy waves (2C); Type 3 is curly hair, featuring large loose curls (3A), tighter ringlets (3B), and dense corkscrew curls (3C); and Type 4 is coily or kinky hair, which includes soft coils with an S-pattern (4A), Z-shaped curls with shrinkage (4B), and very tight, fragile coils with minimal definition (4C). Each type has unique characteristics and care needs, making it helpful to know your type when choosing hair products and styling techniques.
